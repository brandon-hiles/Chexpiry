# Chexpiry

## Inspiration
When it comes to a healthy future, ensuring our cities are sustainable is critical - and can be contributed to through small, deliberate steps. Statistics show that a single family wastes around 275 kg of food per year, so we wondered how we could impact this. In our own kitchens, food is often disposed of because it has gone bad. Foods were forgotten about and perhaps over-purchased. We imagined a solution - an app called Chexpiry that could identify how much longer a food would be good, remind users to consume or freeze the item soon, and make suggestions to the user.

## What it does
Chexpiry has three main features- Shopping, Pantry and Suggestions- which all contribute towards minimizing food waste by informing the user of the fruits and vegetables' short shelf lives.

The Shopping feature of the app is to be used at the end of each grocery run. When the user takes a picture of their produce groceries and upload it to the app, the app identifies the food items and returns the estimated number of days each type of food would last in that given household. If the estimated number of days for the food to be eaten exceeds the shelf life of the food, the app notifies the shopper and encourages them to drop certain food items.

Pantry feature is a page for the user to keep track of the vegetables and fruits in their fridge as well as their estimated shelf lives. The items are automatically added to the Pantry upon grocery picture upload and stay on the list until "Removed" by the user, after it has been eaten.

Lastly, the Suggestions feature reminds the user of the existing food items in the pantry that are approaching their estimated shelf lives. This feature begins to send reminder notification to the user 3 days prior to the estimated shelf life, recommending recipes or food preservation methods to reduce food waste.
